### Homework

This is a Covid-19 warm-up assignment inspired by generative art practices. It builds off our previous experience with looping and our in-depth exploration of nested loops in class. You will make two sketches.

The first should make use of a grid by using nested loops. You can integrate images or colors. Based on what you learned from creating a version of 10print, onsider how chance operations (coin flips, etc) can create some amount of variation in the work. You may deviate from a grid if you otherwise use nesting loops. Your goal is to integrate both form and code. Don't stop at the first outcome. Rework until you get a composition you are excited about sharing.

Your second sketch should be a variation of the first. Begin by duplicating the sketch and then explore. It should not be a slight variation but instead a departure, a tangent, something that radically transforms the outcome of the first. You may do this with variations on the code, using new source images (if you used any), or in other ways.
