# Final Project 

Our assignments so far have been fairly restrictive. For your final project, I want to open up the field for you to create an artwork of your choice. The project should use skills and tools we developed this semester. You don’t need to use p5.js if there is another library or language that you prefer. 

Final Project and presentations/critiques due Thursday 12/17 during our 3pm - 5:30pm session.

So far in this course we have covered:

* variables
* arrays
* the debugging process
* functions
* classes and objects
* loops
* conditionals
* working with the web as platform 
* history of artists working with programming and creating their own tools
* history of procedural and algorithmic art
* how math and computation can be used in the creation of works of art and design
* cultural, political and social issues inherent in computation and addressed in the work of new media artists

Consider these elements in the creation of your own work for the final project.

### Works to examine

The following projects were created with p5.js

[Protest Korpe](https://protestkor.pe/en/) by Friends of Asya Tulesova (Aisha, Kuat, Irina and Jeff), to create banner images that can be shared on social media

> PROTEST KORPE is inspired by quraq körpe, a type of Kazakh quilt. Like a quraq körpe, civic activism and protection of our rights depend on the voices and contributions of each of us. In this work, each square on our "collective quilt" is important to sew a new Kazakh reality. We want: a fair trial for Asya Tulesova, police that do not resort to violence, and just laws which respect peaceful assembly.

[Room Me](https://kikikikikat-room-me.glitch.me/) by Kat Zhang

> An interactive visual essay/game that explores self-isolation and self-care during quarantine.

[Cyber Flowers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cyberflowers/emijohgjnlcnakfgdnjkmicgbdpmhjaf) by JPL, a Chrome extension for the browser

> With simple and repeated revolving, I created a new form of text art that I'd like to call Cyberflowers - made of digital typography and grew from the digital texts in the cyberspace. Here you can see how individual letters gradually break their shape-based meaning and become blooming cyberflowers while the curves and lines become cyber-petals and cyber-stamens.


[Soundings](https://soundings.kunsthalleamsterdam.nl/) - Loren Britton and Romi Ron Morrison, a browser extension and sound art piece that interacts with your browser

> Here we recite selections of poems some by Black Feminist poets & scholars: Audre Lorde and Alexis Pauline Gumbs, and invite you to read some lines from Claudia Rankine. We will invite you to consider how fully you can feel in your daily doings, how the erotic is a well of everyday affirmation....

[Suburbia Life](http://suburbia.life/) by David Schnitman

> suburbia.life is a procedurally generated suburban neighborhood created with p5.js. The sketch features roads, houses, trees and clouds as seen from a bird.


## Optional Theme

You are welcome to propose your own conceptual idea. 

Optionally, here is a theme you are welcome to use:

**Hide part of the world**

If you adopt this theme as a prompt, you are welcome to interpret this in whichever way you see fit.
  
## Your final project should have a separate document with the following info

1. Final Project title
2. approximately half page summary of project consisting of 1. conceptual idea and 2. technical detail
3. What was your approach or strategy did you take in creating your project?
4. What frameworks, libraries, did you use, if any?
5. What other artists, projects or artworks did you research that led to the creation of this work?
6. Include at least 2 screenshots of your project running.

Your code should:

- be clear and organized
- use comments and modular functions to make your code clear and easy to follow
- work without bugs
- work properly in fullscreen

Your final project should:

- Create a compelling interactive visual artwork synthesizing both concept and technical execution
